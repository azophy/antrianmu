=========

Simple online ticketing for physical queue. Designed to require no registration.

This project is an MVP that I created iteratively for several days. However I later found that this project may require more maintenance & resource than I could reasonably spare, so I decided to abandon it and open source its code. I would be happy if it could be a source for learning for other people.
